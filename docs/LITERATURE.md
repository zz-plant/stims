# Scientific literature reference map

This guide collects published scientific literature that can serve as grounding references for the **Stim Webtoys Library** positioning: interactive, audio-reactive visuals for playful sensory stimulation and exploration, with particular relevance to neurodiverse audiences. Use these references when documenting the rationale for audio-visual mappings, multisensory experiences, or sensory processing considerations. It also links literature themes to product features so citations are specific rather than generic.

## How to use this list

- **Cite by claim**: pick references that directly support the user-facing statement you are making (e.g., audio-visual binding, crossmodal correspondences, sensory processing differences).
- **Avoid medical claims**: unless there is a direct study matching the exact claim, keep language descriptive (e.g., "audio-reactive visuals" or "sensory exploration") rather than therapeutic.
- **Prefer review papers** when summarizing broader phenomena; use primary studies for specific phenomena.
- **Connect to a feature**: each citation should point to a concrete UI or toy behavior (see the mapping below).

## Feature-to-literature map

Use the following table to tie literature to specific features so citations are meaningful and traceable.

| Feature or behavior | UI surface | Recommended literature focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audio-reactive visuals (frequency to motion/color mapping) | Toy descriptions, audio onboarding copy | Multisensory integration & audio-visual binding; crossmodal correspondences |
| “Synesthetic” or linked audio-visual patterns | Toy description for synesthetic-themed visuals | Crossmodal correspondences & synesthesia-related perception |
| Sensory exploration language (non-therapeutic) | Library landing copy, toy overview cards | Sensory processing differences in neurodiversity (framed as diversity, not treatment) |
| Music-driven engagement/affect | Demo audio option, descriptions referencing musical response | Music, rhythm, and affective engagement |

## UI citation/footnote guidance

If the UI references scientific grounding, use lightweight footnotes so users can inspect sources without cluttering the interface.

- **Footnote trigger**: Only add citations when a claim implies scientific backing (e.g., “audio-visual binding,” “crossmodal mapping,” or “sensory processing diversity”). Avoid citations for purely aesthetic language.
- **Placement**: Prefer a footnote marker in the toy description block, settings tooltip, or info panel. If a toy has a “Learn more” link, put citations there instead of inline.
- **Format**: Use numeric footnotes with a short bibliography in the same UI panel or a linked “Sources” drawer. Keep them readable on mobile.
- **Linking**: Use DOI links when available; otherwise link to the publisher or journal landing page.

## Multisensory integration & audio-visual binding

These sources describe how auditory and visual stimuli are combined, perceived, and bound in human perception—useful for explaining audio-reactive visuals.

- Stein, B. E., & Meredith, M. A. (1993). *The Merging of the Senses*. MIT Press.
- Shams, L., Kamitani, Y., & Shimojo, S. (2000). What you see is what you hear. *Nature*, 408(6814), 788.
- Spence, C. (2011). Crossmodal correspondences: A tutorial review. *Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics*, 73(4), 971–995.

## Crossmodal correspondences & synesthesia-related perception

Relevant when describing systematic mappings between audio properties (pitch, timbre, rhythm) and visual properties (color, motion, spatial position).

- Marks, L. E. (1978). *The Unity of the Senses*. Academic Press.
- Ward, J. (2008). *The Frog Who Croaked Blue: Synesthesia and the Mixing of the Senses*. Routledge.

## Sensory processing differences in neurodiversity

These references cover sensory modulation and processing differences commonly discussed in neurodiversity research. Use when talking about sensory experience diversity or accessibility.

- Ben-Sasson, A., et al. (2009). A meta-analysis of sensory modulation symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. *Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders*, 39, 1–11.
- Baranek, G. T. (2002). Efficacy of sensory and motor interventions for children with autism. *Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders*, 32(5), 397–422.

## Music, rhythm, and affective engagement

If describing how rhythmic or musical inputs shape engagement or emotional response, these sources provide grounding.

- Thaut, M. H. (2005). *Rhythm, Music, and the Brain*. Routledge.
- Juslin, P. N., & Västfjäll, D. (2008). Emotional responses to music: The need to consider underlying mechanisms. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 31(5), 559–621.

## Notes on scope

- This list is not exhaustive; it is a starter set aligned with the current positioning of the library.
- Add new references as new claims or toy mechanics emerge (e.g., motion coupling, haptic feedback, or attention effects).

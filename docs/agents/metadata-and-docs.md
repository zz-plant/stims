# Metadata & Documentation Expectations

## Metadata conventions

- **Commit messages:** concise, descriptive titles in sentence case (no trailing period), e.g., `Add docs on data flow`.
- **PR summaries:** include a short summary plus explicit lists of tests run and any docs touched or added so reviewers can verify coverage.

## Documentation expectations

- Refer to `docs/README.md` for the documentation map when adding or updating docs.
- Keep the docs in `docs/` and the root `README.md` in sync with workflow or toy changes so contributors can find updated guidance.

# User-Focused Critiques by Toy

This guide captures user-standpoint critiques for each Stim toy based on the current registry metadata, helping prioritize onboarding, controls, and clarity improvements alongside visual polish.

## 3D Toy (`3dtoy`)
- Strength: The twisting tunnel premise is easy to understand and promises immediate audio feedback.
- Friction: As an archived toy, it may feel less polished or consistent with newer UI patterns.
- Opportunity: Add a quick hint about which frequencies drive the tunnel so users feel in control.

## Aurora Painter (`aurora-painter`)
- Strength: The “paint aurora ribbons” pitch and gestural controls signal creativity and depth.
- Friction: Multiple controls (density, pinch/rotate, mood switching) can overwhelm first-time users.
- Opportunity: Offer a one-click “starter” preset or tooltip to surface the strongest effect quickly.

## Pottery Wheel Sculptor (`clay`)
- Strength: Sculpting is a clear, tactile activity with high engagement potential.
- Friction: Tool sets (smoothing/carving/pinching) can be hard to discover without guidance.
- Opportunity: Add a lightweight “first sculpt” overlay or animated affordances.

## Evolutionary Weirdcore (`evol`)
- Strength: Surreal, evolving landscapes promise novelty and replay value.
- Friction: Abstract effects can feel disconnected if audio reactivity is subtle.
- Opportunity: Provide a “boost reactivity” toggle to make the music link obvious.

## Microphone Geometry Visualizer (`geom`)
- Strength: Direct mic-driven geometry implies strong user agency.
- Friction: Quiet environments can make it feel inert or unresponsive.
- Opportunity: Add a visible mic-level meter and an obvious demo-audio path.

## Halo Visualizer (`holy`)
- Strength: Layered halos and particles suggest a rich, hypnotic mood.
- Friction: If interactions are minimal, users may perceive it as passive.
- Opportunity: Expose a simple intensity/palette control for immediate agency.

## Multi-Capability Visualizer (`multi`)
- Strength: Combines sound + device motion for a more embodied experience.
- Friction: WebGPU and motion permissions can block entry on some devices.
- Opportunity: Add a clear preflight screen plus “try without motion” guidance.

## Synesthetic Visualizer (`seary`)
- Strength: Promises tight audio-visual mapping and cohesive patterns.
- Friction: Mapping may be opaque to new users.
- Opportunity: Label which frequency bands map to which visual elements.

## Terminal Word Grid (`legible`)
- Strength: Retro text grid and live word surfacing is distinctive.
- Friction: Users may not see how audio changes influence word timing.
- Opportunity: Offer word cadence controls and clearer audio linkage hints.

## Spectrograph (`symph`)
- Strength: Gentle motion is calming and approachable.
- Friction: Some users may want stronger motion in louder environments.
- Opportunity: Add a sensitivity slider or intensity toggle.

## Grid Visualizer (`cube-wave`)
- Strength: Mode switching between cube waves and spheres adds variety.
- Friction: Mode changes may feel subtle without clear UI feedback.
- Opportunity: Provide a prominent mode toggle with visible state.

## Bubble Harmonics (`bubble-harmonics`)
- Strength: The bubble split on high frequencies feels playful and reactive.
- Friction: Users without high-frequency input may miss the split effect.
- Opportunity: Add a demo trigger or sensitivity adjustment for splits.

## Cosmic Particles (`cosmic-particles`)
- Strength: Dual modes (orbiting swirls + nebula fly-through) add breadth.
- Friction: Switching can disrupt flow if the transition is jarring.
- Opportunity: Use smoother transitions and explicit mode labels.

## Audio Light Show (`lights`)
- Strength: Shader and palette swapping supports personalization.
- Friction: Without a “best-of” starting look, users may not land on a satisfying style.
- Opportunity: Add curated presets or a shuffle button for quick exploration.

## Spiral Burst (`spiral-burst`)
- Strength: Beat-synced expansion encourages rhythmic engagement.
- Friction: Beat detection can feel soft if sensitivity is low.
- Opportunity: Provide a beat sensitivity slider or pulse indicator.

## Rainbow Tunnel (`rainbow-tunnel`)
- Strength: Continuous motion and color produce immersive flow states.
- Friction: Constant forward motion may be fatiguing for some users.
- Opportunity: Add speed control or a stationary camera option.

## Star Field (`star-field`)
- Strength: Soothing visuals for ambient listening.
- Friction: Lack of interactivity can feel passive.
- Opportunity: Add twinkle intensity or parallax controls.

## Fractal Kite Garden (`fractal-kite-garden`)
- Strength: Explicit density + palette controls promote customization.
- Friction: “Pattern density” may be ambiguous without feedback.
- Opportunity: Show a small preview or tooltip on density changes.

## Tactile Sand Table (`tactile-sand-table`)
- Strength: Audio + tilt control offers tactile depth.
- Friction: Desktop users may not realize tilt is a key feature.
- Opportunity: Add a clear “try on mobile for tilt” hint and desktop fallback messaging.

## Bioluminescent Tidepools (`bioluminescent-tidepools`)
- Strength: Drawing glowing currents plus sparkle feels novel and expressive.
- Friction: Users might not know which control most affects the wow factor.
- Opportunity: Highlight “glow strength” or provide a guided preset.

## Neon Wave (`neon-wave`)
- Strength: Synthwave + bloom visuals are recognizable and strong.
- Friction: Heavy bloom can be harsh for sensitive users.
- Opportunity: Provide a “soft glow” accessibility toggle.

## MilkDrop Proto (`milkdrop`)
- Strength: The MilkDrop-inspired feedback engine promises power-user depth.
- Friction: “Proto” implies rough edges and may confuse expectations.
- Opportunity: Add a short “what this is” primer and a suggested preset.

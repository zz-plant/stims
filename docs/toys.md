# Tactile Sand Table Notes

Use these quick references when launching or testing the tactile sand table toy:

- **Controls**
  - *Grain size* adjusts the displacement height of the sand ripples so you can go from shallow grooves to tall dunes.
  - *Damping* controls how quickly waves settle—higher values calm the table, lower values keep motion lingering.
  - *Gravity lock* freezes gravity to a neutral, downward pull. Handy on desktop or when you want a stable plane.
  - *Re-center* resets both gravity and lock state to the default downward orientation.
- **Audio mapping**
  - Low frequencies drive the deepest ripple punches; mids add secondary rings. Quiet passages leave the surface nearly flat.
- **Mobile tilt**
  - On phones and tablets with motion access, tilting the device steers the gravity vector so sand slides toward the low edge. If motion isn’t available or permissions are denied, the toy falls back to a gentle downward pull.
- **Desktop defaults**
  - Desktop browsers without motion data start with the gravity lock engaged. Unlock to animate the table with the default gravity vector and still use audio-driven ripples.
- **Performance tips**
  - Drop the quality preset to cap pixel ratio on battery-constrained devices, and reduce grain size plus increase damping if frame times climb.

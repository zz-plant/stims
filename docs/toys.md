# Tactile Sand Table Notes

Use these quick references when launching or testing the tactile sand table toy:

- **Controls**
  - _Grain size_ adjusts the displacement height of the sand ripples so you can go from shallow grooves to tall dunes.
  - _Damping_ controls how quickly waves settle—higher values calm the table, lower values keep motion lingering.
  - _Gravity lock_ freezes gravity to a neutral, downward pull. Handy on desktop or when you want a stable plane.
  - _Re-center_ resets both gravity and lock state to the default downward orientation.
- **Audio mapping**
  - Low frequencies drive the deepest ripple punches; mids add secondary rings. Quiet passages leave the surface nearly flat.
- **Mobile tilt**
  - On phones and tablets with motion access, tilting the device steers the gravity vector so sand slides toward the low edge. If motion isn’t available or permissions are denied, the toy falls back to a gentle downward pull.
- **Desktop defaults**
  - Desktop browsers without motion data start with the gravity lock engaged. Unlock to animate the table with the default gravity vector and still use audio-driven ripples.
- **Performance tips**
  - Drop the quality preset to cap pixel ratio on battery-constrained devices, and reduce grain size plus increase damping if frame times climb.

# Toy notes and presets

## Bioluminescent Tidepools

- **Summary:** Draw rippling currents of light; metaball tides bloom with your mic’s crisp highs and sprinkle reactive sparks when treble peaks hit.
- **Suggested presets:**
  - Chill glow: trail length `2.8`, glow strength `1.0`, current speed `0.8`.
  - Punchy surf: trail length `1.8`, glow strength `1.4`, current speed `1.2`.
  - Night drift: trail length `3.4`, glow strength `0.9`, current speed `0.6`.

## Starter presets (P0/P1 rollout)

- `lights`: **best-of starter** — curated high-contrast lighting profile for quick visual payoff.
- `aurora-painter`: **aurora starter** — balanced glow/speed for instant ribbon clarity.
- `bioluminescent-tidepools`: **guided glow starter** — elevated glow strength with moderate current speed.
- `geom`: **reactive starter** — boosted sensitivity for quieter rooms.
- `holy`: **halo glow starter** — stronger halo intensity with balanced particle density.
- `bubble-harmonics`: **harmonic pop starter** — higher split sensitivity with quick manual split follow-up.
- `clay`: **first sculpt starter** — smoothing-first intro then carve.
- `evol`: **reactivity boost starter** — emphasizes music-linked mutation changes.
- `seary`: **mapped flow starter** — frequency mapping overlay promoted on first run.
- `legible`: **pulse typing starter** — faster cadence to make audio linkage visible.
- `cube-wave`: **mode pop starter** — stronger mode contrast and beat response.
- `spiral-burst`: **beat pop starter** — heightened beat sensitivity + pulse indicator emphasis.
- `neon-wave`: **soft glow starter** — reduced bloom intensity for accessibility.

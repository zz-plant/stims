# Developer Docs

This folder contains resources for contributors who are building or maintaining the Stim Webtoys Library:

- [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./DEVELOPMENT.md): day-to-day setup, scripts, workflow, and performance/testing expectations.
- [`TOY_DEVELOPMENT.md`](./TOY_DEVELOPMENT.md): playbook for creating or updating toy experiences, including audio, rendering, and debugging tips.
- [`TOY_SCRIPT_INDEX.md`](./TOY_SCRIPT_INDEX.md): map from each toy/visualizer to the JS/TS entry points it uses.
- [`stim-assessment.md`](./stim-assessment.md): current findings and the remediation plan for the Stim Webtoys Library.
- [`toys.md`](./toys.md): per-toy notes, presets, and other focused references.

If you add new tooling or patterns, update these docs so the next contributor has a reliable starting point.

# Developer Docs

This folder contains resources for contributors who are building or maintaining the Stim Webtoys Library:

- [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./DEVELOPMENT.md): day-to-day setup, scripts, workflow, and performance/testing expectations.
- [`TOY_DEVELOPMENT.md`](./TOY_DEVELOPMENT.md): playbook for creating or updating toy experiences, including audio, rendering, and debugging tips.
- [`TOY_SCRIPT_INDEX.md`](./TOY_SCRIPT_INDEX.md): map from each toy/visualizer to the JS/TS entry points it uses.
- [`MCP_SERVER.md`](./MCP_SERVER.md): how to launch and use the MCP stdio server (`scripts/mcp-server.ts`) and its registered tools.

If you add new tooling or patterns, update these docs so the next contributor has a reliable starting point.
